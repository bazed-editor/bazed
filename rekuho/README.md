# rekuho

The antipode of monaco.

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

### Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open rekuho in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your rekuho:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy rekuho, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
